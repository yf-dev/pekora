# PEKORA: Privacy Enhanced Kawaii Online Resource for Adobe

https://pekora.update.sh/

This tool converts SRT subtitle files into Adobe Premiere Pro-compatible XML files
(specifically, FCP7 XML format).

The converted XML file can be imported into Adobe Premiere Pro and used as text
elements.

All conversion processes are performed within the browser, so the SRT subtitle files are
not uploaded to the server.

## FAQ

### Why is it called PEKORA?

[Usada Pekora](https://www.youtube.com/@usadapekora) is a Japanese virtual YouTuber and we are fans of Usada Pekora and support her activities.

So when starting a new project, we wanted to incorporate her name and decided to name it "PEKORA," even though it may seem a bit forced.

### How do I use it?

1. Prepare an SRT subtitle file. (If you don't have one, you can generate one using [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp))
2. Open https://pekora.update.sh/
3. Click the "Choose File" button and select the SRT subtitle file.
4. If you want, you can change the options like a font name, font size, color of the text, etc.
5. Click the "Download Converted XML" button to download the converted XML file.
6. Import the downloaded XML file into Adobe Premiere Pro.

### What languages are supported?

This tool is not limited to any specific language. However, the font used in Adobe Premiere Pro may not support all languages.

### Why did you make this?

When editing videos in Adobe Premiere, it is necessary to manually input subtitles for all spoken parts.

However, manually inputting subtitles can be a tedious task.

With advancements in AI technology, automatic subtitle generation has also improved. But, there are limited services that support various languages, and more importantly, many people are hesitant to use them due to concerns about potential privacy breaches during the automated subtitle generation process.

By using [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp), it is possible to generate subtitles that support multiple languages without worries of personal information leakage. However, there is a need to convert these generated SRT subtitle files into FCP7 XML files compatible with Adobe Premiere's Text Element.

This tool aims to automate the process of converting SRT subtitle files, generated by whisper.cpp or similar tools, into FCP7 XML files that can be used in Adobe Premiere. This automation reduces the need for manually inputting subtitles in Adobe Premiere.
